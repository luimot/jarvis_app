# Jarvis Concept Studies

This is a tech study for the feasibility of Flutter as RocektPy's Jarvis GUI tech

## Brief explanation

This project tests some Flutter technologies and libraries to understand whether it is a possibility for development and also to study some important State and Navigation Management concepts to develop even if in another tech stack.

## How to run

Basically install flutter, run `flutter doctor` to test if flutter is nicely installed, install Chrome and check if it is set for debugging Flutter and then:

```
$ flutter pub get
$ flutter run -d chrome
```

That should be all!
